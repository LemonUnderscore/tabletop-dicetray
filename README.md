## A Simple React App for Rolling Dice
Good for tabletop games.

A small project for the sake of learning to use React.
I wanted to see how much I could do with only React and Sass;
the CSS is a bit of a nightmare as a result.

The only exception is the total counter which uses React-Spring.

## TODO
- Mobile UI
